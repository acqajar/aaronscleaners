Suede and Leather Cleaning, Repairs, and Alterations
For 10 years, Classic Drycleaners continues to be the ONLY dry cleaner in central Pennsylvania to process our own suede and leather items.  We process all of our Suede and Leather cleaning at our locations.  We pride ourselves on being "The Suede & Leather Experts", and have trained personnel dedicated to taking special care of your suede and leather cleaning needs.  Leather & suede items take about 10 days to process, however, we are happy to accommodate special requests. 

Professional Alterations and Repairs
All of our locations offer professional alterations and repairs.  For fittings, please visit any of our tailors during their regular hours, or by appointment. 

Wedding Gown Cleaning, Preservation & Restoration
